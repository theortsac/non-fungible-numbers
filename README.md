## Non-Fungible Numbers üî¢
The "Non-Fungible Numbers" project lets you own a specific number forever on the Polygon blockchain! It was made in one day by me, after just starting the [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) course. I really liked how it turned out, but it isn't supposed to make money! Each mint costs 0.0000001 MATIC, which means I would need 3.5 million numbers minted to get to $1 worth of MATIC on the contract's balance.
To use the smart contract deployed on the Polygon blockchain, just access [this link](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x96faabece7f7c6421c9a104f2d0cb2611466e584) and click `Contract` (the one with the checkmark). Then you can click read and write contract to start interacting with it! Here is a simple guide if you want to mint your own number:
- Access [this link](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x96faabece7f7c6421c9a104f2d0cb2611466e584).
- Click on `Contract ‚úì`.
- Click on `Read Contract`.
- Click on `isNumberMinted` and put the number you want to mint, then click query, if the result is false you can proceed. If it's true you will need to try another number.
- Click on `Write Contract`.
- Click on `mint`.
- Put the number from the step before before before this one on `_number (uint256)`.
- Put `0.0000001` on `mint` (the field just above `_number (uint256)`).
- Connect your wallet.
- Click `Write`.
- Approve the transaction on metamask.
- You are done, congrats!
- Extra Tip: Go to the [MATIC faucet](https://matic.supply/) and get your free 0.0005 MATIC, which is enough to cover the 0.0000001 mint price. If gas is a high and it can't cover it you can use the faucet up to 3 times a day, so just use it whenever you can and really soon (same day) you will get enough for your own number!
